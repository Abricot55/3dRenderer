# 3dRenderer
This project has been entirely made with java swing. It is a small app that can render any shapes in 3d even tho java swing mostly support 2d only.
There is the possibility to create manually a shape by setting all the triangles that compose it (possible for simple shapes like a pyramid or a cube). There is also the possibility to import .stl files and render them.
